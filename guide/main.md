# Preface

An important thing ot keep in mind is all commands are in shorthand to minimize the characters needed to execute a game or program. This is a design choice that allows for compact code easy that's easy to share. Mapping the builtin commands to longer easier to read is simple to achieve but won't be included by default.

Consider that some command naming takes on a role of "setting" a value or data, like mod sets model, img sets an image, tile sets a tile, etc. The retrieval or "getting" you can think of as get model, or gmod, get image or gimg.
