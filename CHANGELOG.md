## UNRELEASED

## 0.3.1

- Notification system
- Much smaller error output, hopeully easier to read in console or notifications
- New font!
- Text can now be colored!
- gtile command to get asset/texture at tile position, use for checking what's placed where

- Disabled "smooth" camera movement as it was ironically shakey
- Added bad quad data failsafes
- Models with quads can have optional uvs and indexes changed directly just like triangle based models. 4 UV coords per quad. Indexes still optional.
- Initial work for lighting systems, able to include normals in model data
- Mouse command has scroll delta `mouse().scroll`
- Img raster can use pixel command to set individual pixels, not super efficient
- Bug prevented sky raster from updating at the same time as the main raster
- Clearing sky raster actually works now
- Codex 2.1

## 0.3.0

- First big update!
- Sound is on again, oops. Sound libraries were literally not included in previous versions. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- Building inline models with quad arrays will smart unwrap provided texture assets to align to the first 2 vectors of a quad. A skewed quad will still align to this first segment and simply cut into the texture. It will assume aspect ratio for UVs coordinates from the larger of the xy axis to be 1 and the smaller a ratio of their lengths. It'll make more sense if you see it action. Inline models can also have UVs sent in directly if you're hardcore about it or not getting what you want.
- Changed entity.tex to a smart field, not a function, to match up with other properties of an entity. Entities already smartly update the engine with their properties, so encapsulating a texture change into a function was unnecessary. Just say `entity.tex="new texture"`. Easy!
- entity.asset similarly allows changing the model of an entity, if none are found it will default to a blocked version of a texture of the same name ( assuming there is one ). This behavior matches how assets are provided in the spawn function. Keep in mind models will apply their own stored texture mapping when this is used, so if the texture is intended to be overriden you will want to set entity.tex to that new texture after setting the asset
- Codex updated with image userdata type information, all custom types are lowercase to match the aesthetic
- Any codex change like this that's not backwards compatible, no matter how small, means a version bump. Codex is now at 2.0.0 "avacado". The Codex naming is just for dev users to track more easily

## 0.2.4

- removed some unnecessary console printing
- ent offset for better rotation
- some codex bad params
- codex lsp diagnostics to allow lowercase globals
- auto game loader works with new console app

## 0.2.1 - 0.2.3

- various patches to get realease working with new test cases confirming or denying working status
- new render cycle immensely more performant then previous iterations, decoupled user input from renderer ( like it should have been )
- still forming a better system for distributing updates for each OS, initial local CI scripts

## 0.2

- first standalone release

## 0.1

- Only released bundled in the Potion Commotion game
